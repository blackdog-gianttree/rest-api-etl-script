# rest-api-etl-script

This is a Python script (get_tenableio_exposure.py) that uses a REST API for an Extract, Transform and Load (ETL) batch job. The script gets all current vulnerability information from the Tenable.io cloud-based vulnerability scanning service and then formats and writes the data to a Comma Separated Values (CSV) output file.
